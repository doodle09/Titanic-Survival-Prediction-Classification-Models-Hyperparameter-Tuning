Project: Titanic Machine Learning Model Comparison  

This project focuses on building and comparing classification models to predict Titanic survival.  
I used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).  

Steps included:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (missing values, encoding)
- Standardization of features
- Training and evaluation of base models
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV (for Random Forest) and RandomizedSearchCV (for SVM)
- Final comparison based on accuracy and classification report
- Visualization of model performance using a bar chart

The best performing model based on accuracy was the tuned SVM.
